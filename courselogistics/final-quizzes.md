===============================

[Back to Main Page](../index.html)

Document Version: 1.0, 12/9/2021

Final exam period: 
---------------------
During the final exam period, you can re-attempt any of the 10 quizzes from the semester to try to earn a higher grade on that quiz.  The quizzes will be like any of the previous  attempts: same topics as before, same length and format etc.  (While in principle you can attempt all 10 quizzes, there probably isn't enough time to complete them all.)


**When:**  Tues., 12/14, 7:00-10:00 PM

**Where:**  *Not in your usual classroom!*

- Horton's section: Clark 107
- Floryan's section: Clark 108

**Important:** if you plan to take quizzes, please complete [this form](https://forms.gle/cWHu1hDyLh1vnYwX7) telling us which ones you *might* take.  This will help us make sure we have enough copies.  **Complete the form by noon, Monday, Dec. 13.**  Thanks!

Conflicts or Issues with Our Final Exam Period
---------------

Some of you may need to take quizzes at one of two alternative times.  Read the following carefully.  You can take it at an alternate time if:

- You have 2 or more exams in the following exam periods: evening of 12/13; morning of 12/14; afternoon of 12/14
- You have some other issue (travel you can't change, appointment, etc.) that makes it hard for you to be there Tues., 12/14, 7-10 pm.

If you meet one of these criteria, there will only be two other days and times you can take CS4102 quizzes:

- Mon., 12/13:  1:00 - 4:00 pm
- Weds., 12/15:  9:00 am - 12 noon

If you believe you meet one of the conditions above and want to take the exam at one of these other two times, complete [this form](https://forms.gle/t7e3iA8zKguXAgPv9) by **Sunday, 12/12 at noon.** We'll email you back to tell you we've approved your request and give you details about where to go.

Away From Grounds?
------------------
We'd like everyone to take quizzes under supervision in a classroom here. But if you won't be on Grounds, explain that in form listed above. If we are OK with your explanation, then we will allow you to take them remotely. But you must take them in one of the time-periods given above.

Office Hours:
----------------
- There are no more TA office hours this term.
- The instructors have communicated their office hours in some way. (Horton's are posted on Piazza.)
- We'll monitor Piazza for questions, so feel free to ask there.

Good luck on CS4102 quizzes and all else you have going!  When it's all done, have a wonderful break! Stay well and safe!  Happy Holidays! 

Oh yeah: please complete the course evaluation before midnight on Fri., 12/10.  :-)
