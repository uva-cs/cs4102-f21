<a name="syllabus"></a>Syllabus
------------------------------------------

The syllabus for the course can be found [here](./syllabus.pdf). Most (but not all) of that information is summarized here.

<a name="lectures"></a>Lectures
------------------------------------------

Each lecture in this course will be **split into two halves**, a *asynchronous recorded portion* and a *live in-person portion*. Some details on each can be found below. The total combined time for these lecture portions will be equal (or very close) to the normal lecture time (1 hour, 15 minutes). 

- The **asynchronous recorded lecture** will be posted to the Collab Panopto Tool. This recording is intended to introduce the basic core material for each lecture. Students can watch this before class, or during the first half of class, before the in-person portion begins.
- The **live in-person portion** of class will take place on Zoom, and will focus on extra examples, more complicated proofs, and other such things that require or benefit from an in-person explanation.

Because of this split, the first 35 minutes of lecture will be reserved for students who wish to watch the recorded lecture during reserved class time. For example, if class is scheduled from 11-12:15, there **will not** be class from 11-11:35 so students may watch the recording (or students may watch it ahead of time, up to you). In-person class begins at 11:35 and will proceed until 12:15.

<a name="textbook"></a>Textbook
------------------------------------------

You will really need to read and study material other than the slides. There are many choices where you can get more details about our topics, but a textbook is the easiest option.
We’ll post readings from the following textbook, and we urge you to read them or get that info from another source.

*Introduction to Algorithms* by Cormen, et. al., 3rd edition.  Referred to as "CLRS".  UVA Library has a digital version of CLRS available [online for free](https://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/u6757775)


<a name="lectures"></a>Quizzes
------------------------------------------

The course is divided into **4 overarching modules**, which are listed below.

- **Module 1: Divide and Conquer / Sorting**: Goes over the divide-and-conquer algorithm paradigm and how to solve recurrence relations to analyze runtimes of such algorithms. Introduces divide and conquer based sorting algorithms as well.
- **Module 2: Graph Algorithms, MST, and Find-Union**: Reinforces the graph data structure and associated algorithms (BFS, DFS) and moves towards more advanced graph algorithms, including more rigorous analyses and more details of implementation.
- **Module 3: Greedy Algorithms and Dynamic Programming**: Focuses on recursive solutions to problems, and how greedy algorithms can be used to quickly solve some problems. Introduces Dynamic Programming and Memoization to deal with overlapping subproblems.
- **Module 4: Network Flow and Reductions**: Introduces a class of problems known as network flow, incuding the max-flow min-cut theorem and related algorithms. Introduces the concept of comparing problems through reductions and moves to concepts in P,NP,NP-Completeness.

The course contains exactly **5 quizzes**. One per module and a final quiz on *putting it all together*. Each quiz can be taken multiple times, and each quiz can be in one of 3 states:

- **Incomplete**: The quiz has not been passed to any level of satisfaction yet.
- **Satisfactory**: The student has shown knowledge in this area, but significant issues / problems have still been observed.
- **Mastered**: The quiz has been fully passed to our satisfaction. The student knows the material, even if they show minor errors or flaws on the quiz.


<a name="homeworks"></a>Homeworks and Grading Policy
----------------------------------------------------------

In this course, there are **4 overarching course modules**. Each module contains **2 basic homeworks** and **2 advanced homeworks**. As these are submitted, each assignment is graded on a simplified grading scale shown below:

- **Incomplete**: The submission is not yet up to standard. This means programming assignments have major flaws or written assignments do not show competency in the course material. A grader will point out at least specific major flaw in the assignment.
- **Satisfactory**: The assignment has been given clear effort, and is close to solving the problem(s) at hand. The assignment has clear, noticeable issues still but significant progress has been made.
- **Mastered**: The assignment is perfect or near-perfect. The homework can have minor flaws and still be considered "mastered".


<a name="final"></a>Final Exam
----------------------------------------------------------

There is no proper final exam in this course. The final exam time will be used to allow students to have a **final attempt on any quiz that is not yet passed**. Details on this will be announced as the final exam time comes nearer.

<a name="lettergrades"></a>Final Letter Grades
----------------------------------------------------------

Once the semester has ended. Each student will have a set of basic homeworks, advanced homeworks, and quizzes that are each at one of the three grading levels (incomplete, satisfactory, or mastered). To calculate final grades, simply count how many of each type of assignment is satisfactory and how many of each type are mastered. Look up the **highest row in the table below for which you reach or exceed the requirements** and that is your final course letter grade.

| Letter Grade | BH: S | BH: M | AH: S | AH: M | Q: S | Q: M |
|:--------------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| F | - | - | - | - | - | - | 
| D- | 4 | 2 | - | - | 1 | 0 | 
| D | 3 | 3 | - | - | 0 | 1 | 
| D+ | 2 | 4 | - | - | 1 | 1 | 
| C- | 4 | 4 | - | - | 2 | 1 | 
| C | 3 | 5 | - | - | 1 | 2 | 
| C+ | 2 | 6 | - | - | 0 | 3 | 
| B- | 1 | 7 | - | - | 1 | 3 | 
| B | 0 | 8 | - | - | 0 | 4 | 
| B+ | - | - | 1 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 
| A- | - | - | 2 | 2 | 0 | 5 | 
| A | - | - | 0 | 4 | - | - | 
| A+ | - | - | - | 7 | - | - | 

**Legend**

- **BH: S** is number of basic homeworks at the satisfactory level, but not higher
- **BH: M** is number of basic homeworks mastered
- **AH: S** is number of advanced homeworks at the satisfactory level, but not higher
- **AH: M** is number of advanced homeworks mastered
- **Q: S** is number of quizzes at satisfactory level, but not mastered
- **Q: M** is number of quizzes that have been mastered
- A **blank row** translates to *No change from the row above*. This makes the table easier to read.
