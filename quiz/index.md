<a name="introduction"></a>Quiz Results / Curves / Pass Thresholds
--------------------------------------- 

This page contains info on how your quiz grades on Gradescope translate into passing grades, or high-pass grades. To pass a quiz you need to earn an **80%** or higher and to earn a high-pass you need a **90%** or higher. However, there is a **curve** that is added to your flat score (as shown on Gradescope) to help everyone out a bit. If your score + curve is higher than **80%**, then you pass a quiz. 

Alternatively, you can check to see if your score on Gradescope (without the curve points added) hits the threshold shown in the **before curve** columns of the table below. If you take your score (on Gradescope) and add the curve points to it, then you would look up that sum in the **after curve** columns below.

The following two tables contain the pertinent information.  The first table is for   attempts that happened in lecture, and the second table is for the re-takes during the final exam period.

| Quiz | Attempt | Max Points | Curve | Pass Score (before curve) | Pass Score (after curve) | High-Pass Score (before curve) | High-Pass Score (after curve) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Module 1 | 1 | 20 | 1 | 15(75%) | 16(80%) | 17(85%) | 18(90%) |
| Module 2 | 1 | 15 | 1 | 11(73%) | 12(80%) | 12.5(83%) | 13.5(90%) |
| Module 3 | 1 | 16 | 1 | 12(75%) | 13(81%) | 13.5(84%) | 14.5(91%) |
| Module 1 | 2 | 18 | 1 | 13.5(75%) | 14.5(81%) | 15.5(86%) | 16.5(92%) |
| Module 2 | 2 | 16 | 1 | 12(75%) | 13(81%) | 13.5(84%) | 14.5(91%) |
| Module 3 | 2 | 15 | 1 | 11(73%) | 12(80%) | 12.5(83%) | 13.5(90%) |
| Module 4 | 1 | 21 | 0 | 17(81%) | 17(81%) | 19(91%) | 19(91%) |
| Module 5 | 1 | 18 | 1 | 13.5(75%) | 14.5(81%) | 15.5(86%) | 16.5(92%) |
| Module 4 | 2 | 23 | 0 | 18.5(80%) | 18.5(80%) | 21(91%) | 21(91%) |
| Module 5 | 2 | 17 | 1 | 13(76.5%) | 14(82.4%) | 14.5(85%) | 15.5(91%) |
| Module 6 | 1 | 20 | 1 | 15(75%) | 16(80%) | 17(85%) | 18(90%) |
| Module 7 | 1 | 18 | 1 | 13.5(75%) | 14.5(81%) | 15.5(86%) | 16.5(92%) |
| Module 8 | 1 | 21 | 1.5 | 15.5(73.8%) | 17(81%) | 17.5(83%) | 19(90.5%) |
| Module 6 | 2 | 22 | 1.5 | 16.5(75%) | 18(81.8%) | 18.5(84.1%) | 20(90.9%) |
| Module 7 | 2 | 19 | 1.5 | 14(74%) | 15.5(82%) | 16(84%) | 17.5(92%) |
| Module 8 | 2 | 19 | 1.5 | 14(74%) | 15.5(82%) | 16(84%) | 17.5(92%) |
| Module 9 | 1 | 18 | 1.5 | 13(72%) | 14.5(80%) | 15(83%) | 16.5(91%) |
| Module 10 | 1 | 18.5 | 1.5 | 13.5(73%) | 15(81%) | 15.5(84%) | 17(92%) |

The following are the curves for the re-takes given during the final exam period. Unlike the ones above, they have NOT been adjusted to the nearest half-point. Your score in GradeScope must reach the "before curve" value to achieve that level of pass -- there will be no rounding up.

| Quiz | Attempt | Max Points | Curve | Pass Score (before curve) | Pass Score (after curve) | High-Pass Score (before curve) | High-Pass Score (after curve) |
| --- | --- | --- | ---   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Module 1 | 3 | 22 | 2.1 | 15.5(70.5%) | 17.6(80%) | 17.7(80.5%) | 19.8(90%) |
| Module 2 | 3 | 18 | 1.5 | 12.9(71.7%) | 14.4(80%) | 14.7(81.7%) | 16.2(90%) |
| Module 3 | 3 | 15 | 2.0 | 10.0(66.7%) | 12(80%) | 11.5(76.7%) | 13.5(90%) |
| Module 4 | 3 | 18 | 1.5 | 12.9(71.7%) | 14.4(80%) | 14.7(81.7%) | 16.2(90%) |

| Module 6 | 3 | 17 | 1.1 | 12.5(73.5%) | 13.6(80%) | 14.2(83.5%) | 15.3(90%) |

<a name="introduction"></a>Regrades
--------------------------------------- 

Regrade requests will be accepted via the *Gradescope regrade tool*. We ask that you adhere to the following guidelines when submitting regrades:

- You should only submit a request if your passing status will change as a result of the request. For example, don't submit a regrade request if your exam is "passed" and getting a few more points will keep your grade as "passed".

- You MUST explain the exact reasoning behind your request. If you just say "I feel like this deserves more points", or "that seems harsh", or "my friend put the same answer down" then we will ignore the request. You need to say "I put the answer X and because of lecture Y that is the correct answer" or "Grading guideline X says 1 point is awarded for statement Y and I say statement Y in my answer when I write ...". In short, you need to **justify** the request.
