<a name="introduction"></a>Overview
---------------------------------------

Module 1's quiz is on lectures and readings from Feb. 1 through Feb. 24.  The following topic list is a guide, and we may update it before the quiz in response to student questions.  See the slides and recordings for more details and readings associated with these topics.  A basic rule we'll try to follow is this: if it's in the readings, but we didn't mention it in lecture, it will *not* be on the quiz.

<p>Document Version: 1.0, 11/12/2021</p>
<h2 id="how-the-quiz-will-be-given-and-other-rules">How the Quiz Will Be Given and Other Rules</h2>
<p>The quizzes will first be given on paper and in-class on 11/16/2021. You can try one or all of the quizzes in the class that day. On the 2nd quiz day, last week of class (watch for an update) you can re-take any or all of these. You can also re-take any or all of these during the final exam period.</p>
<p>The quizzes will be closed-book, closed-notes, etc. Getting information from any electronic devices is not allowed while taking a quiz. You will sign a pledge on each quiz paper.</p>
<p>It is an honor violation to communicate information about the quiz to anyone who might not have yet taken it.</p>
<h2 id="topics-that-might-be-covered-on-the-module-6-quiz-include">Topics that might be covered on the Module 6 quiz include:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dijkstra’s Shortest Path and Prim’s MST algorithm

<li>Why decrease-key operation affects our time-complexity</li>
<li>How to use indirect heaps to make decrease-key more efficient</li>
<li>Overall time-complexity for Dijkstra’s and Prim’s</li>

<li>Optimal substructure property for the problem the algorithm solves</li>
<li>Time and space complexity for the algorithm</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Greedy Algorithms (general topics)
<ul>
<li>Terminology: optimization problems, feasible solutions, objective function, optimal solutions, etc.</li>
<li>Greedy choice property (greedy choice): what this means, and what it is for each algorithm we studied</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Module 7 Homework: could be some questions about the Daycare problem definition and what you’re asked to solve, but you should be able to answer these even if your current solution isn’t working completely</li>
